# Branching Strategy

## Overview

This project uses a simple branching strategy to manage code changes and teamwork efficiently.

## Branches

- **main/master**: Stable code for production. No direct commits.
- **develop**: Integration branch for testing. Feature branches merge here.
- **feature: New feature development.
- **bugfix: Bug fixes.


## Conclusion

By following this strategy, we ensure a smooth development process and maintain a clean and organized codebase.

Using a well-constructed .gitignore file helps keep your repository clean, organized, and focused on relevant code. By ignoring unnecessary files, you can enhance collaboration and reduce potential issues when working with version control.

You can significantly enhance the security of your project, minimize the risk of data breaches, and ensure that sensitive information is handled in a responsible and secure manner.
